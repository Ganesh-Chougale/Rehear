1. `record`: This package is excellent for recording audio. It provides simple APIs to start, stop, pause, and resume recording, and to save the output to a specified file path. It handles platform specifics for microphone access and audio encoding.  
```yaml
# pubspec.yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  record: ^latest_version # Check pub.dev for the latest version
```  

2. `just_audio`: This package is robust for audio playback. It offers fine-grained control over audio playback, including playing from local files, network streams, and managing playback states (playing, paused, stopped, loading). It also supports advanced features like looping and speed control, which might be useful for future enhancements.
