1. `record`: This package is excellent for recording audio. It provides simple APIs to start, stop, pause, and resume recording, and to save the output to a specified file path. It handles platform specifics for microphone access and audio encoding.  
```yaml
# pubspec.yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  record: ^6.0.0
```  

2. `just_audio`: This package is robust for audio playback. It offers fine-grained control over audio playback, including playing from local files, network streams, and managing playback states (playing, paused, stopped, loading). It also supports advanced features like looping and speed control, which might be useful for future enhancements.  
```yaml
  just_audio: ^0.10.4
```  
 
3. File System Access üìÅ  
`path_provider`: Essential for getting platform-specific paths to commonly used locations on the device's file system (e.g., application documents directory, temporary directory). This is where you'll store your audio notes.  
`file_picker`: To allow users to select existing audio files from their device to import into the app for editing.  
```yaml
  path_provider: ^2.1.5
  file_picker: ^10.2.0
```  
4. `flutter_riverpod`: A popular and modern state management solution that offers compile-time safety and testability. It's an excellent choice for a modular application like ReHear due to its provider-based approach.  
```yaml
  flutter_riverpod: ^2.6.1
```  
5. `audio_waveforms`: Directly supports the crucial "Waveform display" feature.  
```yaml
  audio_waveforms: ^1.3.0 
```  
6. `permission_handler`: to handle permission  
```yaml
  permission_handler: ^12.0.1
```
